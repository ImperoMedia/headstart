# headstart_theme

This repository includes all parts of the Headstart Theme I am creating that is based off of _S (underscores theme) and includes many additional SCSS files and assets. The goal is to take _S and make it ready for the average developer to jump right in with instead of having to set it up for each project.

Feel free to join me in this creation and help get this theme ready for use by anyone.

Included in this Headstart theme are:
* _S (Underscores Theme)
* Bootstrap Grids for Sass
* Animate.css link in header
* Material Design color pallete in Sass
