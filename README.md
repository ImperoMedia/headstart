# headstart_theme

This repository includes all parts of the Headstart Themework (Theme/Framework) based off of _S (underscores theme) and includes many additional SCSS files and assets. The goal is to take _S and make it ready for the average developer to jump right in with instead of having to set it up for each project.

Do NOT attempt to install this theme directly from a downloaded .zip file. The theme is inside the .zip file and should be extracted first. Once I have a stable version, I will remove the assets and host the Theme file by itself. This line will be deleted when that happens. If you are reading this, extract before installing.

Feel free to join me in this creation and help get this theme ready for use by anyone.

Included in this Headstart theme are:
* _S (Underscores Theme)
* Bootstrap Grids for Sass from nervewax/bootstrap-sass
* Animate.css link baked into header file
* Font Awesome CSS stylesheet link baked into header
* Material Design Sass color pallete
* Media querie mixins from eduardoboucas/include-media

Out of the box, this theme can use Bootstrap grids, animate.css, material design colors, Font Awesome fonts, simple media query mixins, a bunch of other handy mixins I've found (see mixins-master.scss for updated list) and some handy variables preset to get off and running quickly.
